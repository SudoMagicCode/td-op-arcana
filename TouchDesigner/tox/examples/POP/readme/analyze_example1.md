# Analyze

Data analysis

Provides tools to extract valuable information from a set of points. The resulting data can be applied as attributes or used directly as values.

## Example

In this example, we calculate the centroid of a point cloud.
The centroid (or geometric center) of a set of points represents the average position of all the points in the group. It is akin to the "center of mass," assuming each point hasequal weight.
To determine the centroid in an n-dimensional space, calculate the mean of each coordinate independently.
